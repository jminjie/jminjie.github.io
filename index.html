      </h3>
      <p><p>Trigger warning: politics and bad writing<br>Estimated reading time: 5-10 minutes.</p>
      <p>I.</p>
      <p>When my <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/">Blue Tribe</a> friends talk about politics today, they like to talk about how it is insane that Trump is the leading republican candidate (current polls put him at around 35%, with Ted Cruz closely behind at around 30% among republicans). They like to talk about how he is a terrible person who says sexist and racist things. I routinely hear the phrase&nbsp;&ldquo;I honestly don&rsquo;t understand what goes through the minds of those supporting him.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the narrative; Trump is the bad guy and his supporters don&rsquo;t realize it.</p>
      <p>Every once in a while I like to engage in Political Mind Stretching, and so this morning I found myself browsing /r/The_Donald, the subreddit dedicated to Donald Trump&rsquo;s 2016 Presidential campaign. Among my Red Tribe friends, and the subreddit, what I observe is a general feeling that many people these days just believe whatever they hear. That we don&rsquo;t do our research; we hear something once in the media, and then immediately jump to conclusions without thinking. The Blue Tribe, in this narrative, are not being led by a terrible evil mastermind, rather they have gone astray because they have forgotten to think for themselves.</p>
      <p>II.</p>
      <p>These two narratives remind me of two kinds of movies: Movies About  and Movies About Zombies. Movies About Dracula aren&rsquo;t just about Dracula; retellings of the story include such things as Sherlock Holmes&rsquo;s (with RDJ or Benedict Cankersore) arc against Moriarty; the secret conniving foe who tricks people into doing his bidding so that he can amass more power and alleviate his boredom. Sherlock Holmes has hundreds of story arcs and yet recent years seem to have us focusing on this one particular story; where all the bad things that have happened are revealed to have been connected; where everything was part of the evil ONE&rsquo;s plans.</p>
      <p>Likewise, Movies About Zombies aren&rsquo;t just about zombies. Action movies where the hero has to navigate a mass of bureaucratic red tape just to do the right thing &ndash; where hundreds of officers who are all too afraid of bending the rules let evil triumph through their lack of agency &ndash; these movies are at their core stories about overcoming mindless zombies. Granted these zombies are tamer than actual zombies who incessantly try and convert you by eating you, but if at any point in the movie someone tells the heroic contrarian that he needs to stop rocking the boat and do things the way they have always been done it&rsquo;s easy to see how that&rsquo;s kind of like trying to eat you.</p>
      <p>If the Blue Tribe is afraid that Trump is like Dracula and the Red Tribe like his followers that somehow don&rsquo;t see his obviously evil power grab, then the Red Tribe is afraid that the Blue Tribe is a bunch of zombies, listening to whatever the media says, who are too scared or too brainless to go against the status quo.</p>
      <p>An explanation like this also ties in <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/03/04/a-thrivesurvive-theory-of-the-political-spectrum/">Scott&rsquo;s guess</a> that Blue Tribe values are what happens when you are optimizing for a mostly well off society and Red Tribes values, for a society in danger. In a world where people have pretty high welfare but one baddie up in a tower is trying to ruin things, we probably don&rsquo;t need a police force to watch over the citizens,&nbsp;love should be more or less free and helping others is a safe decision. In a world where mindless zombies are slowly taking over, it becomes pertinent to be suspicious of outsiders, own your own guns, and an emphasis should be placed on practical skills rather than University learning. It&rsquo;s also worth noting that I&rsquo;m not the first to come up with this <a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_19402_6-mind-blowing-ways-zombies-vampires-explain-america.html">Dracula v. Zombies</a> analogy, though interestingly they seem to have drawn the exact opposite comparison.</p>
      <p>III.</p>
      <p>So which narrative is right? Let me preface this by saying that obviously neither narrative is completely right and also both are idiotic. But which one is closer to describing the true state of affairs? It&rsquo;s always very tempting for me to try and generalize on my personal experience, but if we&rsquo;re trying at a guess of how <i>everything </i>is right now, anecdotal evidence is going to do more harm than good.</p>
      <p>What kinds of things would we expect to see at a large scale if the Blue Tribe narrative is right? Probably things like Trump supporters unwilling to admit Trump&rsquo;s faults despite clear evidence of his malice. I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re there. It&rsquo;s not obvious to me that Trump is attempting a malicious power grab. It&rsquo;s not clear that the things he wants are objectively wrong, rather than just being out of line with Blue Tribe values (don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I think these values are important and more productive than a lot of other values, but there&rsquo;s still nothing <i>objective</i> about them). Mostly it is clear that he doesn&rsquo;t put a lot of thought into what he says. In fact it seems to me like most of his supporters embrace his flaws rather than deny them.</p>
      <p>What if the Red Tribe narrative is right? We would expect to see things like increased impact of the media on popular opinion, decreased scientific literacy rates, and a general anti-intellectual vibe which comes with a tendency to repeat things without fact-checking. This is made confusing by the fact that US Universities have a Blue-leaning bias, so that most degree-holding academics will tend to hold Blue Tribe values, but consider that most of your friends who can&rsquo;t stand Trump probably know a lot less about him than his supporters, and they would probably lose in an argument simply because Trump supporters in University have to know a whole lot about Trump just to get through their classes, and have probably already had the argument umpteen times with other Blue Tribe folks who haven&rsquo;t done their research.</p>
      <p>IV.</p>
      <p>When a viewpoint makes me upset, I always need to find out whether it&rsquo;s because of the things being valued or the logic behind the argument. If I think the life of an unborn child is more valuable than the autonomy of the pregnant woman, there&rsquo;s nothing <i>illogical</i>&nbsp;about concluding that abortion is murder. Yet it hurts my head at a very deep level when somebody says the issue is as simple as &ldquo;abortion is murder.&rdquo; It doesn&rsquo;t hurt my head like that when someone proposes the equally value-based&nbsp;&ldquo;a woman has a right to do what she wants with her body.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s because one feels like an attack on my values. It isn&rsquo;t, but it still feels like it. One of the things that sets me off like dust on a computer screen is when someone accuses an opponent of using flawed logic when what they mean is that their values diverge. It is notably less toxic to yell at your opponent&nbsp;&ldquo;I GUESS WE VALUE DIFFERENT THINGS!&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;YOUR LOGIC IS WRONG.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Society tends towards liberal values. Not Blue Tribe values, necessarily, but towards being more liberal about things. Systems get bigger; people become more accepting, or don&rsquo;t and die after <a href="http://trulytuneful.tumblr.com/post/60230435683/what-do-you-do-when-you-meet-ignorance">having more accepting kids</a>. In America today, bias across party lines is <a href="https://pcl.stanford.edu/research/2014/iyengar-ajps-group-polarization.pdf">several times more severe</a> than bias across racial lines. Want to spend your life screaming about Dracula or zombies? Don&rsquo;t waste your time. If what you&rsquo;re trying to do is make room for more love in the world, which I assume is what your Tribes values are supposed to be all about, start by having at the Blue-Tribe-Red-Tribe line instead.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Throughout this essay I will look at our current situation with regards to wind generated electricity. I will make observations about why we haven’t done more to switch to alternative energy than we have, and I will explain how we can solve these issues. I am not so much interested in promoting a specific type of alternative energy source as I am in understanding the reason we don’t utilize alternative energy sources. I will explain how the problems of wind energy, efficient heating, energy saving light bulbs, and better gas mileage are all actually manifestations of the same basic micro-economics problem. Once I solve the problem, I will apply the solution to each case and discuss its implementation. <a href="#foot1">[1]</a></p>
      <p>Coal energy is non-renewable and responsible for emission of terrible amounts of greenhouse gases which are destroying our planet’s ozone layer and contributing to dangerous climate change. Wind energy is perfectly renewable and clean. Why then, I wonder, do Americans still get almost half of our electricity from coal, while wind energy accounts for less than 1% of our electricity generated? The most apparent and easy answer is that coal is cheaper to utilize and cheaper to implement. You might point out that burning coal is extremely damaging to the environment, however, our continued use of coal seems to suggest that coal’s benefits somehow outweigh this fact. When we actually do consider the long term effects, however, it becomes clear that the short term benefit (saving money) is actually easily outweighed by the eventual consequences (destroying the planet). So why exactly do we still rely so heavily on coal energy?</p>
      <p>An economist might break down this problem into a more complicated system of incentives. First of all, we should ask ourselves why coal energy is preferred over wind energy – that is, why is using wind to generate the USA’s electricity more expensive than using coal? The problem with our windmills is locale; windmills have to be built in places with wind. These tend to be areas in rural America, with a lot of space, but very few people. That means the electricity generated from a windmill would either be wasted on relatively few residents, or it would have to be transported to everyone else. Unfortunately, to transfer electricity across the country would take a large network of interstate power lines – infrastructure that does not exist and would be extremely expensive to establish. For this reason widespread use of wind-generated electricity is not feasible without the proper infrastructure in place. So why don’t we just invest in the infrastructure? For the policy maker, you might point out, the initial investment may be expensive, but the eventual gains would be worth it. Environmental impact aside, wind is free but you have to pay for coal; we’re talking about the difference between a monthly subscription fee and a one-time initial fee. Surely the prospect of this investment paying for itself would be a strong enough incentive, right?</p>
      <p>As it turns out, consumers tend to value instant gratification more than long term investment. In many ways, this makes a lot of sense. Suppose the cost of setting up multi-state power lines is 2 million dollars <a href="#foot2">[2]</a>. If the state of Montana spends only 100,000 dollars on coal each year, it will take 20 years before this infrastructure pays for itself. You have to make a 20 year commitment to energy without knowing what new innovations will be created over the next 20 years, how these innovations will affect the economy, how these shifts in the economy will affect the price of coal, or what research will come to light about the use of coal. Not only do you have to put faith into an unpredictable and unreliable future, but you will also have less money to spend on other things for those 20 years if you invest the 2 million. How, then, can we take these incentives and manipulate them in such a way that one might actually want to make that investment?
      Imagine that you are looking to buy a new house, and you are particularly interested in the amount of money you will have to spend on heating the house. You know that if you put 12,000 dollars more into the initial construction of the house, they can take that money and use it to better insulate your windows, walls, doors and roof. Suppose that this will lower your monthly heating bill from 400 dollars to 350 dollars. On the one hand, if you make the investment, you will save 600 dollars a year and after 20 years, once your insulation has paid for itself, every additional month you live in that house you save another 50 dollars on heating. On the other hand, you cannot be sure that you want to live in that house for the next 20 years, and you don’t like the idea of having to stay there to break even. You also don’t like that this investment will set you back a large sum that you would otherwise have been able to pay to a heating company in small installments. Here we have another situation in which the instant gratification comes into conflict with the long term benefits.</p>
      <p>But, if we suppose now that the government, in an effort to promote energy-saving policies, now wants to get involved, we can manipulate these incentives in a way that can make the energy-saving option more favorable. The government offers to cover your 12,000 dollar investment to be paid back at 500 dollars a year (roughly 40 dollars a month). If you take the government up on their offer, then you no longer pay for the initial investment. You have to pay only 350 dollars a month for heating and 40 dollars a month to the government which amounts to a total monthly heating cost of 390 dollars, still less than the 400 dollars you would be paying if you didn’t make any investment at all. The government decides to bill you for 26 years instead of just 24 years, collecting 13,000 from their 12,000 investment, in effect loaning you money with a 8% interest rate. Now you have more incentive to have the government pay for the insulation of your house; not only do you pay less money per month, but you now get to keep your spending money, the government backs up your insulation investment for you, and you get to help the environment by using less energy.</p>
      <p>If we apply this concept to the problem of wind energy, we might come up with a solution like: if the federal government loans money to a local community, this community can use the money to develop its infrastructure until it is capable of supporting widespread wind energy, and a portion of the money saved from the switch to wind energy will go back to the government to pay back their investment over time. Though it is conceptually very appealing this is, of course, a simplification of a very complicated problem.</p>
      <p>You might notice, for instance, that to cover the government’s interest, you are actually paying them an extra 1000 dollars over the span of two years. This is money that’s coming out of your income; money that you would otherwise have kept. Also, the amount of energy you can save by insulating your house better is fairly small – small enough that the individual homeowner sees little financial or environmental impact from his own energy saving house, though the combined impact may still be quite significant. If a single consumer has little to gain from saving energy, how can we encourage a community of homeowners to acknowledge the importance of saving energy? To address this problem, it might be easier to turn the question around. Rather than looking at why consumers see very little to gain from saving energy, we can look at why they see so little to lose from wasting a little energy.</p>
      <p>Electricity is a considerably cheap utility. Most people have little incentive to, say, turn off the lights when they leave a room because it only costs a few extra cents (leaving a light on for an hour costs 0.004$ – less than half a cent). Economists classify incentives into three categories: financial incentives, moral incentives, and social incentives. Because the financial and environmental impacts of leaving the lights on are so small, each individual homeowner has very little financial and moral incentive to save electricity. Likely as a result of this, wasting energy is still generally socially acceptable and there is also little social incentive to save energy. This division into three fronts also makes it easier to create policies that will encourage energy saving. For example, if a law were established decreeing that all large office buildings had to switch to motion-sensor activated lights, an artificial social incentive would be created; you either save electricity, or you break the law. Or else you might raise the price of electricity to provide a financial incentive for consumers to save electricity. A more general solution would be to invest in technology that uses electricity more efficiently; pushing for the switch from incandescent light bulbs to fluorescent bulbs, for example.</p>
      <p>Applying this solution to the heating of homes, we also get a number of ideas. One such idea is to require this level of insulation while offering government assistance to finance it. Another, to inflate the price of un-insulated heating so that the amount of money saved becomes larger. In general, it might also be a good idea to invest in more efficient types of insulation and heating. And, if the heating of homes is an emulation of the use of windmills, then we might also assert that the government should mandate a switch to wind energy by requiring the construction of necessary infrastructure, that they should tax coal energy, but not wind energy, and that they should invest in making wind-harnessing technology more efficient.</p>
      <p>It is, however, hard to guarantee the effect of blanket policies like these. Consider for a moment the plight of the American auto industry. You might think that as the efficiency of the engine has gone up and the average fuel mileage of our cars has increased, the amount of gasoline used would have gone down; since we need less gas to travel the same distance, we should be using less gas. On the contrary, according to the IEA, our total gasoline usage has actually increased. To be fair, though, our population is always expanding. With more drivers, you would expect to see more gas used. But divide the amount of gas used by the number of cars on the road, and you’ll find that the gasoline used per car has also gone up. What, then, could be the explanation for this trend?</p>
      <p>It turns out that consumers tend to take advantage of better fuel mileage by driving more. To explain why that is, imagine that you live near or in a city and you recently purchased a new car. With your old car, which gets 20 miles to the gallon, you found that you had to spend about 150 dollars a month on gas expenditures. When you get your new car to replace it, you expect to continue spending around 150 dollars a month on gas. But if this new car gets 35 miles to the gallon, then you will quickly realize that you don’t have to worry so much about gas. Your car’s fuel economy is now so efficient that you can afford to drive it more often, perhaps even driving to a nearby store that you might have walked to before you bought your new car. The increased efficiency of the car engine has actually created a financial incentive for you to drive more and use more gasoline.</p>
      <p>So we can see how implementing effective policies might be less than straight-forward. But does this in any way diminish the importance of creating cars with better fuel mileage or investing in alternative energy? No; it merely stands to demonstrate the complicated dynamics at work in a real system. The tidiness of an appealing solution does not always translate into a pragmatic implementation. Though I have shown, in theory, why our current efforts at switching to alternative energy have been weak and how to manipulate the system in ways that will make these efforts stronger, it is hard to say what these manipulations will do in practice. And, while it may be extremely tempting to guess, we must remember that micro-economics is used to explain the past. Imagine, one last time, that you are a policy maker. You cannot know for certain what effect any of these policies would have, so how could you trust yourself to implement the policies? Economists don’t profess to be able to predict the future. They have trouble trying to rationally create a model of the future consumer’s choices because, simply put, consumers are not rational. For this reason, we should be content with concluding our discussion of these solutions with a big disclaimer: nothing presented in this essay can exactly be guaranteed – but it’s not the guarantee that makes the essay interesting anyway.</p>

      <p><a name="foot1">[1]</a> Levitt and Dubner in Freakonomics, the inspiration for my essay, take a similar unconventional approach. Through an emulation of their style, I hope to establish my credibility in a very transparent manner so that the reader understands that I am trustworthy, unassuming and well-informed.</p>
      <p><a name="foot2">[2]</a> This essay uses numerous hypothetical figures to illustrate the logic of the argument. It should be noted that these numbers, while good estimates of actual cost, are purely imaginative. Though they are useful as a tool, these estimates are also limited – the important thing to derive from my examples is the accompanying argument and not the numbers themselves.</p>

        <a id="conditioned-for-creativity" class="anchor" href="#conditioned-for-creativity" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Conditioned for Creativity
      </h3>
      <p>It has often been said that the great composers had a sort of heaven-sent gift; that they weaved beautiful and intricate scores out of thin air through some sort of esoteric instinct. Copland himself in his essays on how to listen to music mentions the concept of divine inspiration, this idea that some people are born with the ability to create suitable and perfect themes and some people are not. Obviously composers can learn numerous techniques that may help them create more suitable arrangements or eloquently manipulate existing ideas, but they apparently cannot learn the talent of being inspired. This idea seems to make sense; if creativity is the skill of creating something new, how can we be taught to think creatively through things that already exist? At its root, however, this question comes from an incorrect understanding of what it means to be innovative, original, and creative. Consider that any creation is a product of a consciousness or a collection of consciousnesses and that any consciousness is a product of experience. Someone who grew up in the 1800s is different than someone born in the 1990s because they experience different lives: they listen to different music, learn different things in school, they have access to different technology and one of them lives in a world that is 200 years older. In effect, the context of our upbringing (and beyond) controls who we become and how we think. It follows that it should also determine our musical tastes.</p>
      <p>Most people, (teenagers especially,) take a lot of pride in their taste in music. Your musical tastes can say a lot about you: what you value, what you don’t, or how you see the world. And yet, our musical tastes are so heavily based on what type of music our parents played for us when we were kids and what we sought out when we were young – basically what type of music we already listen to. Most people can decide whether or not they like a song within the first twenty seconds of listening to it, and most people will not continue to listen to a song they don’t like. What they don’t realize is that they like the song because they’ve heard songs that sound like that song – be it structurally, melodically, harmonically, texturally or some other ally. They enjoy the compound sense of familiarity and discovery that comes from a recognized piece. Couple that with the fact that our taste in music tends to become unchangeable by age 40, and you’ll see that we’re pretty much conditioned to like a certain type of music for our adult life. Now is this a bad thing? I don’t think so; people are allowed to have their own taste in music, and it turns out that most of us have pretty good taste. But does this say something about the creative process?</p>
      <p>I assert that we create music like we listen to music. We start by emulating a sound that we’ve heard, and we like. A soloist songwriter singing while playing a piano; a guitarist with a bassist and drummer – we pick up on these existing structures while we listen and then we use them to create similar pieces. Our tendency to imitate in our creation, a sort of glorified monkey-see monkey-do, is what gives genres of music a homogenized feeling. It is what makes music sound the same to us, but it is also what prompts us to be innovative. Because the songwriter is not content with blending in, he has to come up with something to add to what exists. Maybe this means trying a different chord progression, adding in an obscure traditional instrument or rejecting genre altogether. This tendency is how true creativity is born. A musician strives to create something new, yes, but he only knows how to because he has heard what exists. (How ironic that our lack of originality is what spurs originality.) So much of the beauty of the art-form comes from what it is building on. Would Bach have been an innovator if not for the established cannon of the church? Would Beethoven have been recognized for his passionate pieces were it not for Hayden’s pre-existing dainty and quaint style? Would Schoenberg have been praised for dismantling tonality if tonality did not exist for him to dismantle? Decidedly no! And that’s a good thing, because music is not something that is separate from context. It is molded by existing context, and it itself defines present context. The music we listen to now will be the music our children’s parents listened to. And the music they listen to will have been derived from ours in such a way that we might think it to be “devil music” or “worthless racket” or even “boring” (what an odd sentiment – that anything as complex and interesting as music could ever be boring). But in actuality, we’ll be about one-quarter right. Their music will certainly be derivative. What we listen to, what hipsters listen to, what weirdos and music nerds and trippers listen to (they listen to Beck) is all based on music that already exists.</p>
      <p>It’s for this precise reason that I always urge people never to be elitist about genre. The common complaint that “all pop music sounds the same” is too often indicative of the over-zealous listener, keen to point out similarities in music but never eager to listen for nuance. Pop music takes a certain type of finesse just like the Beatles play with a certain finesse just like Charlie Parker played with a certain finesse. And the opposite side of the coin is also true; most pop sounds the same just like most of the Beatles sounds the same just like most Charlie Parker sounds the same. (There I said it!) The fact is that music has to be like this for the creative process to work, because to create is to copy. Lucky for us, nothing is an exact copy.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>I’ve always found that defense a little shaky. “Don’t tell me how to live my life,” in response to some sort of criticism or insult. It’s a way for someone to say that you don’t control them. A way to knock them down some, I suppose. The obvious issue with using the phrase in defense of yourself is that you end up telling them how to live their life – by not telling you how to live yours – but I’m not here to dwell on the obvious hypocritical irony. I’m more interested in what it says about the human psyche.</p>
      <p>The easiest place for me to start is to look at a related idea – don’t tell others how to live their lives. Its commonly used as a defense of gay marriage. Why do you care if gay people can get married? It doesn’t affect you so just let it be. For this reason gay marriage is one of the easiest things for people to get behind. All you have to do is assert that people shouldn’t be restricting other people for no reason and suddenly you’re better than a third of the apparent nation. Here’s the thing though – that’s not what it means to support gay marriage.</p>
      <p>Now I know it’s not my place to say, and people always get me on generalizations like this, but hear me out. Being for gay rights because you don’t care what other people do isn’t about defending the principles of love and marriage, it’s just being aggressively adamant about the belief that people should do what they want if it doesn’t concern you. It’s the difference between a bystander who lets things happen and the perpetrator who does the things. And though I insist that apathy like that isn’t healthy for people to lean on, you could point out that at least it still leads to more equality and freedom, so what does it matter?</p>
      <p>It matters for a couple reasons. The first is that this has never changed anyone’s mind about gay marriage ever. That’s because the logic is grounded in the notion that the issue of gay rights doesn’t affect anybody except for gay people. Not only is that totally in contradiction of what opponents of gay marriage believe, but it’s also clearly incorrect for proponents. Someone who values equality would note that a world with legal gay marriage would be a better world, with more equal opportunity. Someone who believes that you should marry who you love would likely believe the same. (Someone who is against gay marriage might perhaps see it as an attack on the sanctity of marriage, or the definition of a Christian marriage. And someone who is just against marriage likely sees it as an endorsement of an unfair legal institution.) These are world changing decisions and it seems lazy and messy to just use the justification “it doesn’t affect you so let it be.” And if the underlying reasoning of this justification is based on false assumptions, then the implication may as well be un-proven too.</p>
      <p>The second reason is because when we let people use this justification and we validate their reasoning, we’re teaching them that they shouldn’t care about what other people want to do. This is a ridiculous notion. For the same reason that communities form from individuals, we have to be curious about other people. We have to be empathetic and controlling and self-righteous for anything to work. For society to work. We have to believe that we are right and other people should follow us in what we believe. And when we resign ourselves to this idea of a non-obligation towards society – that we shouldn’t have to tell others what is right – it makes us borderline nihilistic. It teaches people that they are not worthy of making a change, and it teaches people to be afraid to make that change. “People don’t want to be told what to do, so how about you just let everyone live their lives?” it tells people.</p>
      <p>Well I say that we have an obligation to involve ourselves in other people’s lives. And maybe we’ll fuck everything up and they’ll hate us for it, but it doesn’t matter. We need to be sure that our way is the right way, and we need to meddle with others until they do it our way. And they need to do the same for us, because truly that’s the only way to change things. (I would invoke leaders like MLK Jr, Gandhi and Sean Penn in Milk but I never saw the movie. Suffice it to say that any leader who has ever made social change did so believing that he himself was right and the way things were was wrong). And maybe if we all keep an open mind and give our due diligence we will find out what it really is we want out of this.</p>
