      <p>Throughout this essay I will look at our current situation with regards to wind generated electricity. I will make observations about why we haven’t done more to switch to alternative energy than we have, and I will explain how we can solve these issues. I am not so much interested in promoting a specific type of alternative energy source as I am in understanding the reason we don’t utilize alternative energy sources. I will explain how the problems of wind energy, efficient heating, energy saving light bulbs, and better gas mileage are all actually manifestations of the same basic micro-economics problem. Once I solve the problem, I will apply the solution to each case and discuss its implementation. <a href="#foot1">[1]</a></p>
      <p>Coal energy is non-renewable and responsible for emission of terrible amounts of greenhouse gases which are destroying our planet’s ozone layer and contributing to dangerous climate change. Wind energy is perfectly renewable and clean. Why then, I wonder, do Americans still get almost half of our electricity from coal, while wind energy accounts for less than 1% of our electricity generated? The most apparent and easy answer is that coal is cheaper to utilize and cheaper to implement. You might point out that burning coal is extremely damaging to the environment, however, our continued use of coal seems to suggest that coal’s benefits somehow outweigh this fact. When we actually do consider the long term effects, however, it becomes clear that the short term benefit (saving money) is actually easily outweighed by the eventual consequences (destroying the planet). So why exactly do we still rely so heavily on coal energy?</p>
      <p>An economist might break down this problem into a more complicated system of incentives. First of all, we should ask ourselves why coal energy is preferred over wind energy – that is, why is using wind to generate the USA’s electricity more expensive than using coal? The problem with our windmills is locale; windmills have to be built in places with wind. These tend to be areas in rural America, with a lot of space, but very few people. That means the electricity generated from a windmill would either be wasted on relatively few residents, or it would have to be transported to everyone else. Unfortunately, to transfer electricity across the country would take a large network of interstate power lines – infrastructure that does not exist and would be extremely expensive to establish. For this reason widespread use of wind-generated electricity is not feasible without the proper infrastructure in place. So why don’t we just invest in the infrastructure? For the policy maker, you might point out, the initial investment may be expensive, but the eventual gains would be worth it. Environmental impact aside, wind is free but you have to pay for coal; we’re talking about the difference between a monthly subscription fee and a one-time initial fee. Surely the prospect of this investment paying for itself would be a strong enough incentive, right?</p>
      <p>As it turns out, consumers tend to value instant gratification more than long term investment. In many ways, this makes a lot of sense. Suppose the cost of setting up multi-state power lines is 2 million dollars <a href="#foot2">[2]</a>. If the state of Montana spends only 100,000 dollars on coal each year, it will take 20 years before this infrastructure pays for itself. You have to make a 20 year commitment to energy without knowing what new innovations will be created over the next 20 years, how these innovations will affect the economy, how these shifts in the economy will affect the price of coal, or what research will come to light about the use of coal. Not only do you have to put faith into an unpredictable and unreliable future, but you will also have less money to spend on other things for those 20 years if you invest the 2 million. How, then, can we take these incentives and manipulate them in such a way that one might actually want to make that investment?
      Imagine that you are looking to buy a new house, and you are particularly interested in the amount of money you will have to spend on heating the house. You know that if you put 12,000 dollars more into the initial construction of the house, they can take that money and use it to better insulate your windows, walls, doors and roof. Suppose that this will lower your monthly heating bill from 400 dollars to 350 dollars. On the one hand, if you make the investment, you will save 600 dollars a year and after 20 years, once your insulation has paid for itself, every additional month you live in that house you save another 50 dollars on heating. On the other hand, you cannot be sure that you want to live in that house for the next 20 years, and you don’t like the idea of having to stay there to break even. You also don’t like that this investment will set you back a large sum that you would otherwise have been able to pay to a heating company in small installments. Here we have another situation in which the instant gratification comes into conflict with the long term benefits.</p>
      <p>But, if we suppose now that the government, in an effort to promote energy-saving policies, now wants to get involved, we can manipulate these incentives in a way that can make the energy-saving option more favorable. The government offers to cover your 12,000 dollar investment to be paid back at 500 dollars a year (roughly 40 dollars a month). If you take the government up on their offer, then you no longer pay for the initial investment. You have to pay only 350 dollars a month for heating and 40 dollars a month to the government which amounts to a total monthly heating cost of 390 dollars, still less than the 400 dollars you would be paying if you didn’t make any investment at all. The government decides to bill you for 26 years instead of just 24 years, collecting 13,000 from their 12,000 investment, in effect loaning you money with a 8% interest rate. Now you have more incentive to have the government pay for the insulation of your house; not only do you pay less money per month, but you now get to keep your spending money, the government backs up your insulation investment for you, and you get to help the environment by using less energy.</p>
      <p>If we apply this concept to the problem of wind energy, we might come up with a solution like: if the federal government loans money to a local community, this community can use the money to develop its infrastructure until it is capable of supporting widespread wind energy, and a portion of the money saved from the switch to wind energy will go back to the government to pay back their investment over time. Though it is conceptually very appealing this is, of course, a simplification of a very complicated problem.</p>
      <p>You might notice, for instance, that to cover the government’s interest, you are actually paying them an extra 1000 dollars over the span of two years. This is money that’s coming out of your income; money that you would otherwise have kept. Also, the amount of energy you can save by insulating your house better is fairly small – small enough that the individual homeowner sees little financial or environmental impact from his own energy saving house, though the combined impact may still be quite significant. If a single consumer has little to gain from saving energy, how can we encourage a community of homeowners to acknowledge the importance of saving energy? To address this problem, it might be easier to turn the question around. Rather than looking at why consumers see very little to gain from saving energy, we can look at why they see so little to lose from wasting a little energy.</p>
      <p>Electricity is a considerably cheap utility. Most people have little incentive to, say, turn off the lights when they leave a room because it only costs a few extra cents (leaving a light on for an hour costs 0.004$ – less than half a cent). Economists classify incentives into three categories: financial incentives, moral incentives, and social incentives. Because the financial and environmental impacts of leaving the lights on are so small, each individual homeowner has very little financial and moral incentive to save electricity. Likely as a result of this, wasting energy is still generally socially acceptable and there is also little social incentive to save energy. This division into three fronts also makes it easier to create policies that will encourage energy saving. For example, if a law were established decreeing that all large office buildings had to switch to motion-sensor activated lights, an artificial social incentive would be created; you either save electricity, or you break the law. Or else you might raise the price of electricity to provide a financial incentive for consumers to save electricity. A more general solution would be to invest in technology that uses electricity more efficiently; pushing for the switch from incandescent light bulbs to fluorescent bulbs, for example.</p>
      <p>Applying this solution to the heating of homes, we also get a number of ideas. One such idea is to require this level of insulation while offering government assistance to finance it. Another, to inflate the price of un-insulated heating so that the amount of money saved becomes larger. In general, it might also be a good idea to invest in more efficient types of insulation and heating. And, if the heating of homes is an emulation of the use of windmills, then we might also assert that the government should mandate a switch to wind energy by requiring the construction of necessary infrastructure, that they should tax coal energy, but not wind energy, and that they should invest in making wind-harnessing technology more efficient.</p>
      <p>It is, however, hard to guarantee the effect of blanket policies like these. Consider for a moment the plight of the American auto industry. You might think that as the efficiency of the engine has gone up and the average fuel mileage of our cars has increased, the amount of gasoline used would have gone down; since we need less gas to travel the same distance, we should be using less gas. On the contrary, according to the IEA, our total gasoline usage has actually increased. To be fair, though, our population is always expanding. With more drivers, you would expect to see more gas used. But divide the amount of gas used by the number of cars on the road, and you’ll find that the gasoline used per car has also gone up. What, then, could be the explanation for this trend?</p>
      <p>It turns out that consumers tend to take advantage of better fuel mileage by driving more. To explain why that is, imagine that you live near or in a city and you recently purchased a new car. With your old car, which gets 20 miles to the gallon, you found that you had to spend about 150 dollars a month on gas expenditures. When you get your new car to replace it, you expect to continue spending around 150 dollars a month on gas. But if this new car gets 35 miles to the gallon, then you will quickly realize that you don’t have to worry so much about gas. Your car’s fuel economy is now so efficient that you can afford to drive it more often, perhaps even driving to a nearby store that you might have walked to before you bought your new car. The increased efficiency of the car engine has actually created a financial incentive for you to drive more and use more gasoline.</p>
      <p>So we can see how implementing effective policies might be less than straight-forward. But does this in any way diminish the importance of creating cars with better fuel mileage or investing in alternative energy? No; it merely stands to demonstrate the complicated dynamics at work in a real system. The tidiness of an appealing solution does not always translate into a pragmatic implementation. Though I have shown, in theory, why our current efforts at switching to alternative energy have been weak and how to manipulate the system in ways that will make these efforts stronger, it is hard to say what these manipulations will do in practice. And, while it may be extremely tempting to guess, we must remember that micro-economics is used to explain the past. Imagine, one last time, that you are a policy maker. You cannot know for certain what effect any of these policies would have, so how could you trust yourself to implement the policies? Economists don’t profess to be able to predict the future. They have trouble trying to rationally create a model of the future consumer’s choices because, simply put, consumers are not rational. For this reason, we should be content with concluding our discussion of these solutions with a big disclaimer: nothing presented in this essay can exactly be guaranteed – but it’s not the guarantee that makes the essay interesting anyway.</p>

      <p><a name="foot1">[1]</a> Levitt and Dubner in Freakonomics, the inspiration for my essay, take a similar unconventional approach. Through an emulation of their style, I hope to establish my credibility in a very transparent manner so that the reader understands that I am trustworthy, unassuming and well-informed.</p>
      <p><a name="foot2">[2]</a> This essay uses numerous hypothetical figures to illustrate the logic of the argument. It should be noted that these numbers, while good estimates of actual cost, are purely imaginative. Though they are useful as a tool, these estimates are also limited – the important thing to derive from my examples is the accompanying argument and not the numbers themselves.</p>
