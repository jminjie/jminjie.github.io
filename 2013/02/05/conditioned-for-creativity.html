      <p>It has often been said that the great composers had a sort of heaven-sent gift; that they weaved beautiful and intricate scores out of thin air through some sort of esoteric instinct. Copland himself in his essays on how to listen to music mentions the concept of divine inspiration, this idea that some people are born with the ability to create suitable and perfect themes and some people are not. Obviously composers can learn numerous techniques that may help them create more suitable arrangements or eloquently manipulate existing ideas, but they apparently cannot learn the talent of being inspired. This idea seems to make sense; if creativity is the skill of creating something new, how can we be taught to think creatively through things that already exist? At its root, however, this question comes from an incorrect understanding of what it means to be innovative, original, and creative. Consider that any creation is a product of a consciousness or a collection of consciousnesses and that any consciousness is a product of experience. Someone who grew up in the 1800s is different than someone born in the 1990s because they experience different lives: they listen to different music, learn different things in school, they have access to different technology and one of them lives in a world that is 200 years older. In effect, the context of our upbringing (and beyond) controls who we become and how we think. It follows that it should also determine our musical tastes.</p>
      <p>Most people, (teenagers especially,) take a lot of pride in their taste in music. Your musical tastes can say a lot about you: what you value, what you don’t, or how you see the world. And yet, our musical tastes are so heavily based on what type of music our parents played for us when we were kids and what we sought out when we were young – basically what type of music we already listen to. Most people can decide whether or not they like a song within the first twenty seconds of listening to it, and most people will not continue to listen to a song they don’t like. What they don’t realize is that they like the song because they’ve heard songs that sound like that song – be it structurally, melodically, harmonically, texturally or some other ally. They enjoy the compound sense of familiarity and discovery that comes from a recognized piece. Couple that with the fact that our taste in music tends to become unchangeable by age 40, and you’ll see that we’re pretty much conditioned to like a certain type of music for our adult life. Now is this a bad thing? I don’t think so; people are allowed to have their own taste in music, and it turns out that most of us have pretty good taste. But does this say something about the creative process?</p>
      <p>I assert that we create music like we listen to music. We start by emulating a sound that we’ve heard, and we like. A soloist songwriter singing while playing a piano; a guitarist with a bassist and drummer – we pick up on these existing structures while we listen and then we use them to create similar pieces. Our tendency to imitate in our creation, a sort of glorified monkey-see monkey-do, is what gives genres of music a homogenized feeling. It is what makes music sound the same to us, but it is also what prompts us to be innovative. Because the songwriter is not content with blending in, he has to come up with something to add to what exists. Maybe this means trying a different chord progression, adding in an obscure traditional instrument or rejecting genre altogether. This tendency is how true creativity is born. A musician strives to create something new, yes, but he only knows how to because he has heard what exists. (How ironic that our lack of originality is what spurs originality.) So much of the beauty of the art-form comes from what it is building on. Would Bach have been an innovator if not for the established cannon of the church? Would Beethoven have been recognized for his passionate pieces were it not for Hayden’s pre-existing dainty and quaint style? Would Schoenberg have been praised for dismantling tonality if tonality did not exist for him to dismantle? Decidedly no! And that’s a good thing, because music is not something that is separate from context. It is molded by existing context, and it itself defines present context. The music we listen to now will be the music our children’s parents listened to. And the music they listen to will have been derived from ours in such a way that we might think it to be “devil music” or “worthless racket” or even “boring” (what an odd sentiment – that anything as complex and interesting as music could ever be boring). But in actuality, we’ll be about one-quarter right. Their music will certainly be derivative. What we listen to, what hipsters listen to, what weirdos and music nerds and trippers listen to (they listen to Beck) is all based on music that already exists.</p>
      <p>It’s for this precise reason that I always urge people never to be elitist about genre. The common complaint that “all pop music sounds the same” is too often indicative of the over-zealous listener, keen to point out similarities in music but never eager to listen for nuance. Pop music takes a certain type of finesse just like the Beatles play with a certain finesse just like Charlie Parker played with a certain finesse. And the opposite side of the coin is also true; most pop sounds the same just like most of the Beatles sounds the same just like most Charlie Parker sounds the same. (There I said it!) The fact is that music has to be like this for the creative process to work, because to create is to copy. Lucky for us, nothing is an exact copy.</p>
